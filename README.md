Odin Recipes Project
A brief first project to demonstrate and understanding of HTML, tags, and attributes.

The project is to create a simple main page that has links to several recipes

It will be unstyled, however I will revist this once I have learned more CSS styling and this will be made to look more attractive in the future

This project is designed to help me build the basic structure of a website, including file structures, as well as using git for my VCS
