    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A heart clogging, yet delicious, British classic.</p>
    <p>Crunchy yorkshire pudding, meaty sausages, thick savoury gravy with a hint of onion sweetness, pure perfection</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For the toad</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>8oz all purpose flour</li>
        <li>8 large eggs</li>
        <li>570ml milk</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>6 beef sausages</li>
        <li>3oz beef dripping</li>
        <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the Gravy</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2oz butter</li>
        <li>2 onions, sliced</li>
        <li>1 tbsp instant gravy granules</li>
        <li>1 tbsp yeast extract (like Marmite)</li>
        <li>400ml vegetable stock</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For the toad-in-the-hole, place the plain flour into a bowl and make a well in the centre. Whisk in the eggs and milk to make a smooth batter. Place in the fridge overnight.</li>
        <li>The next day, when you're ready to cook the toad-in-the-hole, preheat the overn to 425F</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the sausages and cook, turning frequently, until browned on all sides</li>
        <li>Place the beef dripping into a roasting tin and place in the oven. Remove the batter from the fridge and whisk lightly until smooth and combined - it may have separated slightly overnight. Add the thyme leaves and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>Remove the roasting tin from the oven, add the sausages and pour over the batter. Transfer to the oven and bake for 35-40 minutes, then open the oven door to remove the steam. Lower the over temperature to 350F and cook for a further ten minutes, until golden-brown. Remove from the oven and leave to stand for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>For the gravy, heat most of the butten in a pan, add the onions and cook for ten minutes, or until soft.</li>
        <li>Add the gravy granules and yeast extract and stir to combine. Add the vegetable stock and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for five minutes until thickened. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir in the remaining knob of butter.</li>
        <li>To serve, place portions of the toad-in-the-hole onto serving plates and pour over the gravy.</li>
    </ol>
